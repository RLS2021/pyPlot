# pyPlotter
This is the repository for a python script I wrote, which draws graphs based on user input

pyPlotter uses the libraries:

**numpy**-in order to create and store the arrays used to make the graph

**matplotlib** - in order to do the graph drawing.

I hope this program can be used as an alternative to more expensive data loggers, as a time effective way of graphing collected data.

Please do note that this is my first GitHub Repo and I am always looking on ways to improve the code, and the repository itself. If you have any advice, please do let me know.

Have a great day!
