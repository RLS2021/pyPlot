# pyPlot
This is the repository for a python script I wrote, which draws graphs based on user input

pyPlot uses the libraries:

**numpy**-in order to create and store the arrays used to make the graph

**matplotlib** - in order to do the graph drawing.

Please do note that this is my first GitHub Repo and I am always lookign on ways to improve the code, and the repository itself. If you have any advice, please do let me know.

Have a great day! ðŸŒž
